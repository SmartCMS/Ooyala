Configuring Reporting over HTTPS (CQ10919)

To run reporting over HTTPS rather than HTTP:

1 Make sure your application server is configured for HTTPS access.

2 Enter the HTTPS port into the ConfigureJasperSoft tool when it asks for the HTTP port.

3 Make sure the scope_server_url in general.properties is an HTTPS URL.

4 Before starting the application server, manually edit scopeserver/WEB-INF/conf/scopeserver.xml. Find the line that says:

<Property name="protocol">http</Property>

and change it to:

<Property name="protocol">https</Property>
